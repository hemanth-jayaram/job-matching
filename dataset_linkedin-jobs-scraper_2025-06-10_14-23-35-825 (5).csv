From pre-computed summaries for email threads, summaries for meetings, and videos created from a document using lifelike AI avatars, our AI opportunity is huge. Our mission is to meaningfully connect people so they can create, build, and grow together and as part of the team you can build how productivity tools should work 5-10 years into the future. You will work with model builders (Google DeepMind), work with exceptional leaders, and have the ability to impact billions of users across the world.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $248,000-$349,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

We're looking for an experienced and visionary Senior Machine Learning Manager to lead the ML strategy and execution for Uber Grocery's Catalog team . This team powers every single consumer-facing experience in the Uber Eats app -from what users see when they open the app to the products they choose at checkout.

As the ML leader on this team, you'll be responsible for building and scaling a diverse range of AI/ML systems that make sense of vast, complex, and ever-evolving grocery data. This includes everything from deep semantic understanding of catalog items to large-scale inventory forecasting and novel computer vision applications that integrate directly with courier workflows. You'll guide a team of talented ML engineers and collaborate cross-functionally with product, design, operations, and platform teams to shape the future of grocery shopping on Uber Eats.

About The Team

The Catalog team sits at the heart of Uber Grocery. If you've ever searched for an item, scrolled through a carousel, or tapped on a product to see more info- that's our work in action . We provide the foundational intelligence that powers the Uber Eats grocery experience.

From an ML perspective, our scope is vast and challenging:


 * Catalog Understanding & Enrichment : We build models that determine what each item really is-its brand, flavor, color, and what kinds of customers might prefer it. Our enrichment models help transform raw merchant data into a delightful user experience.
 * Product Relationships : Our systems learn how products relate to one another-what's a substitute, what's often bought together, and what combinations drive better outcomes for both customers and merchants.
 * Inventory Forecasting : Grocery inventory is volatile and high-stakes. Our team builds and maintains large-scale ML forecasting systems to predict availability and reduce substitutions-at a scale few companies ever reach.
 * Computer Vision for Real-World Mapping : We're pushing the frontier of real-time store mapping using computer vision. Couriers use their phone cameras to help digitize physical grocery stores, feeding our inventory systems with real-time data.
   
   

We're tackling some of the hardest, most high-impact problems in the grocery and ML space-at Uber scale. The team is rapidly growing with high impact and visibility from the top. We are responsible for developing state of the art technology to optimize the pricing and incentives strategy in our platform that directly drives efficiencies and effectiveness across user interactions with Uber.

Minimum Qualifications


 * PhD or equivalent in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics or related field AND 4-years full-time Software Engineering work experience OR 10-years full-time Software Engineering work experience, WHICH INCLUDES 4-years total technical software engineering experience in one or more of the following areas:
 * Note the 4-years total of specialized software engineering experience may have been gained through education and full-time work experience, additional training, coursework, research, or similar (OR some combination of these). The years of specialized experience are not necessarily in addition to the years of Education & full-time work experience indicated.
 * Programming language (e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, or Go)
 * Large-scale training using data structures and algorithms
 * Modern machine learning algorithms (e.g., tree-based techniques, supervised, deep, or probabilistic learning)
 * Machine Learning Software such as Tensorflow/Pytorch, Caffe, Scikit-Learn, or Spark MLLib
 * 4+ years of people management experience
   
   

Technical skills:

Required


 * Deep Learning
 * Scalable ML architecture
 * Experience in applying machine learning models to solve large-scale real-world problems
   
   

Preferred


 * Personalization, user understanding and targeting
 * Optimization (RL/Bayes/Bandits)
 * Causal inference

We're looking for an experienced and visionary Senior Machine Learning Manager to lead the ML strategy and execution for Uber Grocery's Catalog team . This team powers every single consumer-facing experience in the Uber Eats app -from what users see when they open the app to the products they choose at checkout.

As the ML leader on this team, you'll be responsible for building and scaling a diverse range of AI/ML systems that make sense of vast, complex, and ever-evolving grocery data. This includes everything from deep semantic understanding of catalog items to large-scale inventory forecasting and novel computer vision applications that integrate directly with courier workflows. You'll guide a team of talented ML engineers and collaborate cross-functionally with product, design, operations, and platform teams to shape the future of grocery shopping on Uber Eats.

About The Team

The Catalog team sits at the heart of Uber Grocery. If you've ever searched for an item, scrolled through a carousel, or tapped on a product to see more info- that's our work in action . We provide the foundational intelligence that powers the Uber Eats grocery experience.

From an ML perspective, our scope is vast and challenging:


 * Catalog Understanding & Enrichment : We build models that determine what each item really is-its brand, flavor, color, and what kinds of customers might prefer it. Our enrichment models help transform raw merchant data into a delightful user experience.
 * Product Relationships : Our systems learn how products relate to one another-what's a substitute, what's often bought together, and what combinations drive better outcomes for both customers and merchants.
 * Inventory Forecasting : Grocery inventory is volatile and high-stakes. Our team builds and maintains large-scale ML forecasting systems to predict availability and reduce substitutions-at a scale few companies ever reach.
 * Computer Vision for Real-World Mapping : We're pushing the frontier of real-time store mapping using computer vision. Couriers use their phone cameras to help digitize physical grocery stores, feeding our inventory systems with real-time data.
   
   

We're tackling some of the hardest, most high-impact problems in the grocery and ML space-at Uber scale. The team is rapidly growing with high impact and visibility from the top. We are responsible for developing state of the art technology to optimize the pricing and incentives strategy in our platform that directly drives efficiencies and effectiveness across user interactions with Uber.

The years of specialized experience are not necessarily in addition to the years of Education & full-time work experience indicated.
 * Programming language (e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, or Go)
 * Large-scale training using data structures and algorithms
 * Modern machine learning algorithms (e.g., tree-based techniques, supervised, deep, or probabilistic learning)
 * Machine Learning Software such as Tensorflow/Pytorch, Caffe, Scikit-Learn, or Spark MLLib
 * 4+ years of people management experience

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) delivers mission-critical applications for top tier enterprises around the world. Our cloud offers unmatched hyper-scale, multi-tenant services deployed in more than 50 regions worldwide. OCI is expanding its mission beyond the traditional boundaries of public cloud to include dedicated, hybrid and multi cloud, edge computing, and more.

At Technical Strategy and Oversight (TSO) organization, our mission is to support customer choice, transparency, and value when it comes to cloud infrastructure. We’re embarking on ambitious new initiatives such as building high performance primitives, frameworks to support OCI developers, and a new container runtime that will allow us to run the full variety of OCI services, including our most demanding tier one services. We’re also working on new ingenuities such as providing canonical implementation of core components for data planes, developing a remote persistent storage solution with the latency and performance comparable to that of local NVMe drives, and developing standards and tools to identify critical performance improvements across OCI data-planes. We are hoping to enhance engineering efficiency by concentrating our expertise on building low level systems with high performance that can be adopted by our core cloud services across OCI.

To meet the needs of our customers, we are building a new OCI Performance team and looking for a senior engineering leader to: build the team from the ground up, define and deliver new services to improve performance across existing services, and define KPIs for internal service teams that highlight and drive their impact on the efficiency and customer experience.

We are growing fast, still at an early stage, and working on ambitious new initiatives. You will be part of a team of smart, motivated, diverse people, and given the autonomy as well as support to do your best work. It is a dynamic and flexible workplace where you’ll belong and be encouraged.

Who are we looking for?

You’ve built and operated high-scale cloud infrastructure services and understand how to continuously improve the technology and grow the business. You have experience working with services that require data to travel long distances but must abide by compliance and regulations. You have built, grew and managed distributed multinational teams, and owned design, delivery, and operations of a prominent public cloud service.

You are technically strong and have worked on services that are highly available, scalable, and resilient. You can balance feature delivery with iteration and incremental improvements. You’ve made life easier for your engineers and have motivated your teams to make both process and service improvements. You know how to wear the hats of an engineering leader, product owner and project manager at the same time and get a lot done daily.

Do you want to create intelligent, adaptable robots with global impact? At Amazon Robotics, our collaborative team builds high-performance, real-time robotic systems that perceive, plan, and act intelligently alongside humans—at Amazon scale. Our mission is to enable robots to interact safely, efficiently, and fluently through the complex challenges of a company that sells everything, everywhere. We target high-impact algorithmic unlocks in areas such as scene and activity understanding, large-scale generative models, closed-loop control, robotic grasping and manipulation—all of which have high-value impact for our current and future fulfillment networks. Our solutions enable robots to learn from their own experiences, from each other, and from humans to build intelligence that feeds itself.

We are seeking an experienced Applied Science Manager to lead a team of talented applied scientists and software engineers developing and deploying advanced manipulation strategies and algorithms. You will drive innovation that enables manipulation in high-contact, high-density, and diverse conditions with the speed and reliability that will delight our customers. Collaborating with cross-functional teams across hardware, software, and science, you will deliver reliable and high-performing solutions that will scale across geographies, applications, and conditions.

You should enjoy the process of solving real-world problems that, quite frankly, haven’t been solved at scale anywhere before. Along the way, we guarantee you’ll get opportunities to be a fearless disruptor, prolific innovator, and a reputed problem solver—someone who truly enables robotics to significantly impact the lives of millions of consumers.

We are a team that launched the first large-scale Robotic Manipulation capability in 2020 (Robin). The solution has now scaled to a fleet of thousands of robots and has shipped billions of packages. No comparable solutions exist in the world. We have followed it up with newer robots (Cardinal and Sparrow). It's time to scale up to many more types of work, types of robot and even larger fleets of robots to continue to scale our supply chain.

We have come a long way in demonstrating the viability of Robotics at scale but we are still very early in the journey of transforming Amazon Fulfillment and the world. If you are passionate about shaping the future then this is the right opportunity for you.

Lead your team to make changes to existing systems to allow the integration of our robotic workcells into existing infrastructure. Once these services have the features needed the team will move on to developing services that will drive our workcells.

Keep your technical skills current to contribute to architecture and design discussions. Lead your team to evolve our service architecture with quality, robustness and Amazon sized scale as top priorities. You will regularly take part in deep-dive troubleshooting exercises and drive technical post-mortem discussions to identify the root cause of complex issues.

Set a vision for your team and create product roadmaps. Help your team sort out technical and product requirements and priorities. Use project management skills to deliver product roadmap items and other cross-team projects.
